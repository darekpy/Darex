This is an application that automates tedious configuration of a certain smart home system via API. The application is used to automatically translate names of wireless devices registered to the smart home central unit, change their main device name. After that user has an option to automatically create virtual thermostats with proper configuration and assign devices based on the number of room, they were physically installed at. Last option is to automatically create virtual rooms and assign wireless devices and virtual thermostats to them. The user only has to create an authorization token and pass it to the program (simple GUI), then pass the IP of the central unit he is working on. Registration of wireless devices to the central unit has to be done manually.

My application was developed for my colleagues as a personal project and used by them. Instead of them configuring the system for at least few hours, application does it in up to few minutes and it is easy to use thanks to a simple GUI (tkinter).
